            I’m actually a former Journalist and Political Science &
            International Realtions gradute cleverly disguised as a successful
            web developer student. but I’ve tried to focused my energies on the
            web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision. I
            moved to London from Glasgow a few years back, learned the
            web-Development, and have settled in London for the time being. I
            think I’ll stick around here for a while… I’m a junior web
            developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day,
            experimenting with HTML, CSS,JavaScript and React; I build websites
            that delight and inform. I do it well. I’m curious, and I enjoy work
            that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
            direction. I have a good knowledge about how computer works, basic
            maintenace of laptops,desktops and mobile phones. I have studied a
            one year web-Development courses comprises of
            HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,REACT.JS,NODE.js at CodeYorFuture.
